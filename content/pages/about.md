## Here’s what our customers are saying about Blue Moon Organics!

> Hi to all at Blue Moon,
>
> I thought I would take a minute and write this to you to tell you how much we love all the fruits and vegetables we get each week. Since signing on in October (I think), we have loved the variety and quality of the produce. I have a daughter who hates broccoli but has to admit the broccoli we get from you tastes really good. I have never tasted broccoli so sweet. It amazes me each time I eat an apple how wonderful they taste.
>
> Yes, they actually “taste”! The red romaine has been beautiful. My other daughter dislikes potatoes but again, has to admit, the ones we get in the bin taste really good! We love peeking inside each week to see what is there and I just build meals around what comes. I have not gone to the store for produce since receiving your bins. I cringe at the thought. Even the store bought organic doesn’t taste as good. It is also nice to be able to just “budget” that amount. So, as we ate our way through another bin, I thought perhaps I would pass along how very much we love to receive them and how much we appreciate Blue Moon Organics for making this wonderful produce available to us!

> I have been a customer for about 4 years now, maybe longer. I feel that I am still a new customer because your service is exceptional and each box is so fresh and plentiful that its like the first one received. My kids love fruits and vegetables now and Im so happy that I am able to give them such high quality produce when Im so busy with everything else to do with raising a family. Thank you very much.

> Thank you so much for everything. We are so happy with Blue Moon – it is a much better experience than we’ve had with the larger organic companies. The service is second-to-none and the quality of your produce is outstanding! Each box is so fresh, and delicious. Thanks for the wonderful experience.

> Thank you for another great year of produce. My kids now eat all sorts of produce that they would not even try before. It is comforting to have you show up with all sorts of things that we would not otherwise try.
>
> — _Heather, Port Coquitlam_

***

> Your fabulous organic veggies – what delight! It reminds me of sampling fresh veggies as I walked through Grandma’s garden. Even my extremely fussy little girl and wife are enjoying their treats fresh or lightly steamed. What a great, thoughtful, healthy lifestyle you are encouraging. Thanks!

> Great veggies, great service, great people! Highly recommend Blue Moon Organics.

> As a mother of 3 teenagers I am always looking for new healthy ways to prepare meals. I find Blue Moon Organics my answer. The fruits and vegetables are always excellent. I use and enjoy the recipes, they help me try new veggies I wouldn’t ordinarily purchase.

> I was introduced to Blue Moon Organics, by Antal arriving at my door, September, 1997, with a container full of produce and an offer to try it. We discovered carrots, apples and oranges that tasted like none I had ever had before. WOW!
>
> I had been intellectually committed to organic produce before but had been turned off by the high prices and not wonderful looks of produce in the health food store. But this stuff was unblemished and tastes awesome. We have been passionate supporters of Blue Moon ever since.
>
> Along with the incredible taste and the feeling that I am giving my family the best quality with no possible harm, I especially like the variety of produce my family and I are exposed to through the delivery system. We can always say no to something unusual but usually we try it and then are pleasantly surprised–and if the kids don’t like something there is more high nutrition and taste for mom!

***

> My husband and I have been enjoying Blue Moon Organics for several months and are so pleased with the unexpected lifestyle changes! I spend less time in supermarkets now that all my produce comes right to my door. I’m sure I spend less money overall on produce now – yet seem to always have more on hand!
>
> I sent a box of your vegetables to two neighbors and it turned out to be one of the most appreciated gifts I have ever given. Healthier than candy and and like “found money” the household budget!
>
> Thanks for providing such a superb product and service.

> — _Paulette, Coquitlam_

***

> We are extremely pleased with the freshness and flavour of the organic vegetables. There is a noticeable difference from grocery store vegetables and the service of delivery to our doorstep is a wonderful time saver for a busy family.
>
> Blue Moon Organics is always trying to improve their already excellent service to their customers.

***

> Just a note as we pass our first year of your very special organic food delivery. First and foremost we must mention we are extremely pleased with the high quality, freshness and bold taste of everything. We especially like your referral system as many of our friends and associates now enjoy what we have become accustomed to.

> Thanks again and good luck.

> We received our first shipment yesterday and we just wanted to let you know that the quality and freshness was wonderful and we are very pleased. We have been a customer of another organic home delivery for about 8 months and the quality has been very poor lately. We were able to open both bins side by side and compare the quality, difference wow– night and day!! Keep up the great shipments.

***

> We have been purchasing our fruit and veggies from Blue Moon for a few months now and I believe it was one of the smartest decisions we made. We have three children and every Friday we get our bin delivered, the kids are so excited to see what we’ve received. Considering the quality of the produce, the great customer service and delivery to your door, the cost of this service is very reasonable. I would encourage anyone (especially skeptics) to give Blue Moon Organics a try.
