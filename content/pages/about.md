## Here’s what our customers are saying about Blue Moon Organics!

> Hi to all at Blue Moon,
>
> I thought I would take a minute and write this to you to tell you how much we love all the fruits and vegetables we get each week. Since signing on in October (I think), we have loved the variety and quality of the produce. I have a daughter who hates broccoli but has to admit the broccoli we get from you tastes really good. I have never tasted broccoli so sweet. It amazes me each time I eat an apple how wonderful they taste. Yes, they actually “taste”! The red romaine has been beautiful. My other daughter dislikes potatoes but again, has to admit, the ones we get in the bin taste really good! We love peeking inside each week to see what is there and I just build meals around what comes. I have not gone to the store for produce since receiving your bins. I cringe at the thought. Even the store bought organic doesn’t taste as good. It is also nice to be able to just “budget” that amount. So, as we ate our way through another bin, I thought perhaps I would pass along how very much we love to receive them and how much we appreciate Blue Moon Organics for making this wonderful produce available to us!

> I have been a customer for about 4 years now, maybe longer. I feel that I am still a new customer because your service is exceptional and each box is so fresh and plentiful that its like the first one received. My kids love fruits and vegetables now and Im so happy that I am able to give them such high quality produce when Im so busy with everything else to do with raising a family. Thank you very much.
