A local family business since 1997, Blue Moon Organics delivers fresh 100% Certified Organic Fruits and Vegetables right to your door in the lower mainland.

The regular cost of a bin is $38.00, with a onetime refundable deposit of $20.

Every week the content of your bin will be a little bit different, depending what is in season and what is available.

We update our web-page every Friday, so you can see what is offered the following week, and you can make as many changes as you want. Just go on to our web-pages home page, check out what is offered and click on the “click here for substitutions” button. Fill out the form and submit it.

We always try to make it $38.00, but if you order extras or go over the $38.00, we will e-mail you with your new total.

We also offer Organic or Natural MEAT and high quality [Pet Food](/pet-food).

Call Blue Moon Organics today, or [SIGN UP](/sign-up) right now!
