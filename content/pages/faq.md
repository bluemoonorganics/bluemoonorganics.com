It’s easy to get organic produce delivered to your home! Now you can enjoy a convenient and cost-effective way to enjoy Certified Organic fruits and vegetables grown the way nature intended!

### Delivery Areas

Blue Moon Organics delivers fresh 100% Certified Organic produce to doorsteps in Port Moody, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Anmore, Belcarra, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, Mission, Langley, Aldergrove, Burnaby and New Westminster.

### How does it work?

As a customer of Blue Moon Organics, you will receive a fresh selection of guaranteed Certified Organic fruits and vegetables delivered right to your door, weekly or bi-weekly.

Your organic fruits and vegetables arrive on your doorstep in a Rubbermaid container which helps keep produce fresh and crisp for several hours, even in summertime. There is a $20.00 refundable deposit for the container, and after your first shipment, simply leave the container outside your door and it will be exchanged for one filled with your next week’s supply of fresh produce.

### How much produce do I get?

Each 36-litre container consists of 10 -12 items. We provide you with a balanced bin of fruit and vegetables.

There are occasionally delightfully unusual items such as kale, mango's, and sunburst squash.

### How fresh is the produce?

It can’t get much fresher! We pick up the fruits and vegetables fresh each morning from our suppliers and make up the containers at our warehouse and deliver the containers to you the same day.

### What if I don’t know how to cook an item I’m unfamiliar with?

Every week our newsletter includes a recipe featuring less well-known vegetables. The newsletter is e-mailed to you every week. Included in the newsletter is a recipe and some information about organics.

### Can I make substitutions?

Certainly! You can make as many substitutions as you want with each delivery. For example, if you don’t want peppers or onions you can ask for more apples or broccoli (or whatever items you prefer from the week’s selection). Also if there are items you never want, let us know and we will automatically replace those items even if we don’t hear from you.

### What if I want larger quantities?

We can supply you with bulk quantities of any number of different items or if you would like to add an extra pound or two of any of the weekly items we can do that as well, either email us or call the office for a price.

### Where does the produce come from?

Blue Moon Organics uses local farm fresh produce whenever possible. During out of season months we import produce from certified organic farms in warmer climates, usually California.

### How much does it cost?

A container costs just $42.00 for choice of quality, organic produce. Blue Moon Organics guarantees their produce – your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed!
